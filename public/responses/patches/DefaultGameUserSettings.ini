MobileFPSMode=Mode_90Fps # maybe 120? idk, but 90 is the max for now, maybe in the future we can add more modes, but for now we will stick with 90 fps, because it is the most stable and compatible with most devices, and it is also the most popular among mobile gamers, so it is a good choice for our default setting.
